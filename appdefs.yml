    sections:
      - title: License
        level: 2
        content: |-
          {{ app.friendly_name }} supports a cross-platform custom license model,
          which means that a license can be purchased and then be used on all the buyer's
          machines.

          While {{ app.friendly_name }} can be used/evaluated without a license,
          certain features, like renaming files, won't work without one.

          A license can be purchased at https://www.filebot.net/purchase.html.
      - title: Installing a License
        level: 3
        content: |-
          Once purchased, the license file received via email can be saved on the host,
          into the configuration directory of the container (i.e. in the directory mapped
          to `/config`).

          Then, start or restart the container to have it automatically installed.

          **NOTE**: The license file is expected to have a `.psm` extension.
      - title: Donation Supported Version
        level: 3
        content: |-
          In the past, {{ app.friendly_name }} was donation supported, meaning that
          the author was expecting users to donate an arbitrary amount of money if they
          like and use the software.

          The last version of {{ app.friendly_name }} supporting this model is
          `4.7.9`.  This version is implemented in container image version `1.0.2`.

          To revert to this version, create the container by using
          `jlesage/filebot:v1.0.2` as the image name.

          **NOTE**: While no license is required to use this version, it is no longer
          supported and maintained by the author of {{ app.friendly_name }}.
      - title: Automated Media Center (AMC)
        level: 2
        content: |-
          This container supports the {{ app.friendly_name }}'s
          [Automated Media Center](https://www.filebot.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=215)
          (AMC) script.  This script automatically and smartly organizes movies, TV shows,
          anime and music.

          Basically, files copied to the `/watch` container folder are automatically
          renamed and organized to the `/output` container folder.

          Configuration of the AMC script is done via `AMC_*` environment variables. See
          the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for the list and
          descriptions of environment variables that can be set.

          To see what the AMC script is doing, look at the container's log.

          **NOTE**: By default, the script runs in dry mode, meaning that no change is
          performed.  This allows you to verify that results produced by the script are
          correct.  Then, the `AMC_ACTION` environment variable can be updated to perform
          changes to the file system.

          **NOTE**: For the script to properly function, container folders `/watch` and
          `/output` must be properly mapped to the host.  See the
          [Data Volumes](#data-volumes) section.
      - title: Using a Beta Version
        level: 2
        content: |-
          This container provides the stable version of {{ app.friendly_name }}.
          However, it's possible to use a beta version when needed.  This is done by
          setting the environment variable `USE_FILEBOT_BETA` to `1`.

          When set, the custom {{ app.friendly_name }} installation located under
          `/config/beta` (container path) is used instead of the stable version.

          {{ app.friendly_name }} beta version can be installed manually, by
          downloading the portable version from https://get.filebot.net/filebot/BETA and
          extracting the package to `/config/beta`.  Else, the latest beta version is
          downloaded automatically during the startup of the container if no installation
          is found under `/config/beta`.

          **NOTE**: Beta version may have bugs and stability issues.  Use at your own
          risk.
